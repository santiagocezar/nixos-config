  # A flake can have many use cases and different types of outputs.
  #
  # parameters in function `outputs` are defined in `inputs` and
  # can be referenced by their names. However, `self` is an exception,
  # this special parameter points to the `outputs` itself(self-reference)
  #
  # The `@` syntax here is used to alias the attribute set of the
  # inputs's parameter, making it convenient to use inside the function.
