# Dr. Robotnik's Declarative Machines

Largely inspired in [sodiboo's config](https://github.com/sodiboo/nix-config/) :D

  MODEL | NAME    | FORM FACTOR       | DESCRIPTION
-------:|:--------|:------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------
  E-102 | Gamma   | Laptop            | It's powered by a bird, that's probably why it's so slow
  E-123 | Omega   | Desktop           | There's no way it runs on an i5 (but it does)
 E-1001 | Eggpawn | Repurposed laptop | Built to serve, literally
